                    <span style={{color: "darkgoldenrod"}}> Hatfield, Pennsylvania</span>. This organization was established on <span style={{color: "darkgoldenrod"}}> June 2007 </span> to practice religious beliefs for the 
                    local Muslim community. It is a rapidly growing worship center in our Muslim community. In addition to offering services 
                    for five-time Salah a day, we are proud of organizing <span style={{color: "darkgoldenrod"}}> Saturday and Sunday teaching classes for our youths </span> to learn Quran and
                    Hadith. We also run a <span style={{color: "darkgoldenrod"}}> Quran learning class for adults </span> five days in a week, and Hadith discussing sessions every day after 
                    Isha prayer. We also host activities such as <span style={{color: "darkgoldenrod"}}> arranging scholarly talks </span> on important topics addressing the community-related issues 
                    or challenges based on Quran and Hadith for weekend students and for all. <span style={{color: "darkgoldenrod"}}> Arranging educational competition</span>, including Quran 
                    recitation and Islamic essays, have proven to be the <span style={{color: "darkgoldenrod"}}> best way for our youth to learn faster about our beautiful religion </span>. Please
